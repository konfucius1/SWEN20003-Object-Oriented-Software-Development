# Java Basics

## Program Boilerplate

Name of the program here `helloWorld` 

This has to correspond to the name of the file that contains the source code `helloWorld.java`

```java
public class helloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello World");

    }
}
```

Execution of program starts from 

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
```

What does this line mean?
