### Information handling

**Rule of thumb:** Always make attributes **private** otherwise penalised in assignments!

## Mutability

> **Mutable:** A class that contains public mutator methods or other public methods that can change the instance variables. Objects in this class are called **mutable** **objects**
>
> **Immutable:** A class that contains no methods (other than constructors) that change any of the instance variables. Objects in this class are called ***immutable objects***

## Delegation

* A class can **delegate** its responsibilities to other classes

* An object can **invoke methods** in other objects through **containership**

* This what you call an **association** between the classes
